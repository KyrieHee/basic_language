## type basic

* Strongly typed languages and weakly typed languages
  
  * JS是动态弱类型语言，对变量的类型比较宽容，而且不会在这些变量和它们的调用者之间建立结构化的契约。
  
  * The main difference, roughly speaking, between a strongly typed language and a weakly typed one is that a weakly typed one makes conversions between unrelated types implicitly, while a strongly typed one typically disallows implicit conversions between unrelated types.

  * Furthermore a strongly typed language requires an explicit conversion (by using the cast operator) between related types, when there is possibility of data loss, while a weakly typed one would carry out the conversion regardless.
